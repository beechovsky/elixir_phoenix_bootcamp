This repo mostly tracks notes and code (examples and exercises), scratches (my ruminations on the material), and notes from The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp on Udemy.

NOTES:
My notes don't follow the course sections exactly, and instead much of the first several sections are contained in the `intro_elixir.md` file. 

Also, this course was more code-heavy than some, so there are many useful comments in the code.

Finally, the bootcamp is a little out of date, and also doesn't go too in-depth on a few topics I think are important, like concurrency and fault tolerance in Elixir. For this reason, and for wherever descriptions or definitions were lacking, I've supplemented from the official documentation.
