This repo tracks notes and code (examples and exercises), scratches (my ruminations on the material), and notes from The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp on Udemy.

NOTE: My notes don't follow the course sections exactly, and instead much of the first several sections are contained in the `intro_elixir.md` file. Also, this course was more code-heavy than some, so there are many useful comments in the code.

Finally, wherever descriptions or definitions were lacking, I've supplemented from the official documentation.
